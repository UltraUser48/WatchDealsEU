    <h1>Invicta Acquires Glycine </h1>
<p>
    Aquisitions are rarely a surprise in this day and age, and especially in this industry, but we'd be lying if we said we<br> weren't at least a bit surprised to learn that the majority stake of Glycine Watch S.A. has just been sold to the <br>Invicta Watch Group. As pioneers in world-timing aviation watches, Glycine brings over a century of quirky, independent<br> watchmaking to the Invicta name, which itself was also a longstanding family-operated Swiss brand until later purchased<br> in 1991 by a United States-based investment firm.
    Speaking to both the past and present, Glycine's most significant<br> entry to watchmaking has long been the Airman – a 24-hour tool watch that soared to popularity amongst commercial<br> and military pilots in the fifties and sixties due to its rugged build quality and ability to track multiple time zones <br>with its unique locking bi-directional 24-hour bezel. Little has changed, even in later iterations of the Airman, <br> which are still available with the same bezel and in the original "purist" 24-hour form preferred by pilots.<br> The brand's contributions to horology weren't limited to design, but they were largely reserved for the Airman platform,<br> whose earliest iterations were fitted with the Felsa Bidynator – the world's first automatic movement built around<br> a bi-directional winding rotor. Glycine was also one of the first three companies capable of manufacturing<br> automatic watches on a mass scale – a distinction shared with Harwood and Autorist.
</p>
    <p>The next few moves for Invicta are important ones – nearly as critical for the coming months for the Glycine camp,<br> where we could see a fresh invigoration of the brand, or a relegation to the "could-have-been"<br> annuls of pre-takeover watchmaking. </p>
